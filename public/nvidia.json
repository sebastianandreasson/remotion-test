But fundamentally, the conditions are excellent for continued growth, calendar '24 to calendar '25 and beyond, and let me tell you why. We're at the beginning of 2 industry-wide transitions, and both of them are industry-wide. The first one is a transition from general to accelerated computing. General-purpose computing, as you know, is starting to run out of steam. And you could tell by the CSPs extending and many data centers, including our own for general-purpose computing, extending the depreciation from 4 to 6 years. There's just no reason to update with more GPUs when you can't fundamentally and dramatically enhance its throughput like you used to. And so you have to accelerate everything. This is what NVIDIA has been pioneering for some time. And with accelerated computing, you can dramatically improve your energy efficiency. You can dramatically improve your cost in data processing by 20:1, huge numbers. And of course, the speed. That speed is so incredible that we enabled a second industry-wide transition called generative AI. In generative AI, I'm sure we're going to talk plenty about it during the call. But remember, generative AI is a new application. It is enabling a new way of doing software, new types of software being created. It is a new way of computing.",

A whole new industry in the sense that for the very first time, a Data Center is not just about computing data and storing data and serving the employees of the company. We now have a new type of Data Center that is about AI generation, an AI generation factory, and you've heard me describe it as AI factories. But basically, it takes raw material, which is data. It transforms it with these AI supercomputers that NVIDIA built, and it turns them into incredibly valuable tokens. These tokens are what people experience on the amazing ChatGPT or Midjourney or search these days are augmented by that. All of your recommender systems are now augmented by that, the hyper-personalization that goes along with it. All of these incredible start-ups in digital biology generating proteins and generating chemicals and the list goes on. And so all of these tokens are generated in a very specialized type of Data Center. And this Data Center, we call it AI supercomputers and AI generation factories. We're seeing diversity.

The inference part of our business has grown tremendously, we estimate about 40%. The amount of training is continuing because these models are getting larger and larger, the amount of inference is increasing. But we're also diversifying into new industries.

They specialize in NVIDIA AI infrastructure, GPU-specialized CSPs. You're seeing enterprise software platforms deploying AI. ServiceNow is just a really, really great example.

It's not brittle. NVIDIA is the only architecture that has gone from the very, very beginning, literally at the very beginning when CNNs and Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever and Geoff Hinton first revealed AlexNet, all the way through RNNs to LSTMs to every RLs to deep RLs to transformers to every single version and every species that have come along, vision transformers, multi-modality transformers that every single -- and now time sequence stuff. And every single variation, every single species of AI that has come along, we've been able to support it, optimize our stack for it and deploy it into our installed base. This is really the great amazing part. On the one hand, we can invent new architectures and new technologies like our Tensor Cores, like our Transformer Engine for Tensor Cores, improve new numerical formats and structures of processing like we've done with the different generations of Tensor Cores, meanwhile supporting the installed base at the same time.",
